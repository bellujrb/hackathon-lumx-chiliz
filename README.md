## 🌐 Introduction

With the website and api with the lumx external api, which allows using the chiliz protocol, we are able to create and maintain fan tokens, having greater interaction between teams and users. We have a secure exchange system, where if you know a user who wanted to exchange a token with another, our system validates whether they have the token, and they are valid for exchanges. We have a transaction system that guarantees 100% shipping to other users. Our engagement system makes the user even closer to the teams.

## Application Programming Interface Lumx

We use 100% of the Lumx API to do the entire Blockchain application in our API.

## Mocks in Web

Due to lack of time, we decided to leave some mocked things on the website, but our back-end is 100% functional and you can test it yourself on Swagger.
