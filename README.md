## 🌐 Introduction

?????

## Application Programming Interface Lumx

We use 100% of the Lumx API to do the entire Blockchain application in our API.

## Mocks in Web

Due to lack of time, we decided to leave some mocked things on the website, but our back-end is 100% functional and you can test it yourself on Swagger.

### 🔹 Calculator 
We calculate the value of tokens even before our client creates them.

### 🔹 Person Checker
